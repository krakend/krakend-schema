For example: `/foo/{var}/baz`. You can also add an ending `/*` in the path to enable [wildcards](https://www.krakend.io/docs/enterprise/endpoints/wildcard/) (Enterprise only).\nThe router will try to automatically redirect calls to endpoints with an incorrect case or incorrect trailing slash to its correct version offering a `301`. There are no guarantees that it will succeed and the request might even fail completely while trying (and log an ugly error with a trace). The **safest option** is to [disable automatic redirections](https://www.krakend.io/docs/service-settings/router-options/) by setting to true the flags `disable_redirect_fixed_path` and `disable_redirect_trailing_slash` in the `router` options.\n**Limitations**: URLs do not support colons `:` in their definition. All `{vars}` are meant to be isolated in the path and not to be used to build words, like in `/file.{ext}` [See `disable_rest` for that usage](https://www.krakend.io/docs/service-settings/http-server-settings/#disable_rest).\n\nSee: https://www.krakend.io/docs/endpoints/",
